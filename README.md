# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor - Solved
 
For this project, the primary goal was to make the HTML and CSS files readable and well-organized. To do this, I made changes to the HTML, including:
 
## HTML Changes 
- Added comments for each section 
- Changed div tags to semantic tags wherever possible 
- Changed the site title to "Horiseon" instead of "website"
- Ensure all navigation links are working correctly,
 
I also added "Home" links in each of the three sections in the main portion of the page to make navigating back to the top easier. 
 
## CSS Changes 
Changes were also made to the style sheet to condense repetitive styles and reflect changes made to the HTML file, including:
- Condensing h2 styling for the main section
- Condensing h3 styling for the aside
- Renaming classes in the <aside> section to match the elements they style 
 
With these changes, the Horiseon website is on its way to becoming a more professional representation of the company.
 
## Suggested Changes
 Other suggested changes include:
- Using a more visually engaging style for the navigation bar
- Sticking to a consistent color theme that features the colors used in the Horiseon logo (#ffffff, #d9dcd6) and the background color of the header and navigation (#2a607c)
- Formatting the text and images in the <aside> so that they look less choppy and more cohesive
- Reduce the footer size, including the text and style
